# BeginnerDH
A Github website for the ULeth Beginner DH workshop.

This is a github template that you can use to practice HTML and CSS coding. Our basic goal for this class is to understand how basic code works and get some practice in building webpages and using GitHub.

Your first step to using it is to create your own repository from this template using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

The second is to turn on GitHub pages using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

The third is to start editing the page(s) in your local repository.
